## Introduction 
This documentation provides guidance on running the project locally, deployment procedures, and additional information about the project.

## Tech Stack 
The project is built using the following technologies:
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router**: A library for routing in React applications.
- **HTML/CSS**: Standard markup and styling languages for web development.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: The primary programming language for client-side scripting.
- **npm/Yarn**: Package managers for installing project dependencies and running scripts.
- **Web Vitals**: A library for measuring and reporting web performance metrics.

## Running the Project Locally 
To run the project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the project repository to your local machine using Git:
    ```bash
    git clone [repository-url]
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd [project-directory]
    ```
3. Install project dependencies using npm or yarn:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```
4. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```
5. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the project.

## Deployment Procedures 
To deploy the project to a production environment, follow these steps:
1. Build the project:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    yarn build
    ```
2. Deploy the generated build files to your web server or hosting service of choice.

## Additional Information 
- **Folder Structure**: The project follows a standard React folder structure with components, pages, and global styles separated into different directories.
- **Styling**: Global styles are defined in the `global.css` file, while component-specific styles are usually defined inline or in separate CSS files.
- **JavaScript Files**: JavaScript files for specific functionality are located in the `src/pages` directory.
- **Index.js**: The `index.js` file serves as the entry point to the React application and renders the main `App` component.

This concludes the documentation for the project. For further assistance or inquiries, refer to the project's README.md file .
